# PathPilot
PathPilot is a robotics project where a small robot is guided by an overhead camera. Using OpenCV and Python, the camera analyzes the course and plans the optimal path, which the JetBot then follows. This system combines aerial analysis with autonomous navigation for precise pathfinding.
